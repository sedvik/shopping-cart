# shopping-cart
This is an implementation of The Odin Project Shopping Cart Application project

## Purpose
This project was completed in order to practice the following:

1. Additional React development practice
2. React Router use to handle multiple routes

## Application Details
This application simulates a Doily shop application based on a Portlandia skit featured in the Testimonials section. Features include:

1. A home index route with information about the Doily Shoppe (including the referenced Portlandia skit)
2. A shop route with 8 different kinds of deluxe doilies available for (fake) purchase. Users can adjust each specific doily qty before adding it to the cart.
3. A cart route which displays each item added, how many were added, and the total price of that item given the qty. The total shopping cart price is displayed here as well as a checkout button. Cart items can be adjusted here by either changing the quantity or removing them entirely.
